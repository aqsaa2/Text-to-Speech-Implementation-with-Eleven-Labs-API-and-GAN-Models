# Text-to-Speech-Implementation-with-Eleven-Labs-API-and-GAN-Models
This repository demonstrates text-to-speech (TTS) generation using two approaches:  Eleven Labs API for multilingual TTS synthesis with realistic voice outputs. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for TTS generation using TensorFlowTTS models (Tacotron2, FastSpeech, MelGAN, and MB-MelGAN).
